I completed numbers 1 and 2.

For number 2, I may have misunderstood the question to be a bit more complicated than it actually is.
I assumed that the assignment was to store data for multiple matches of one game, as well as overall stats.
I realize now that this is not the case, but the way I wrote it does not prevent it from working for multiple games.
Multiple instances of the Tracker class would need to be created.
Also, the Match class used to be called Game, but once I realized what the problem was actually asking I changed it to avoid confusion.

Hopefully the code included in the Main class helps
